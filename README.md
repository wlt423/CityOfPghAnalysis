# Summary of Key Findings

## Overall:
 This dataset consists of 3.08 million rows across 11 variables that reveals trends in mail-in ballot requests in Pennsylvania. Four of those variables are related to geography and five are a date/time. Finally, for each ballot request, party affiliation is recorded along with an approval code. The analysis therefor focuses on applicant demographics, geographic distribution, party affiliation and ballot return times.

# Key Findings:
 1. Geographic Distribution:  Ballot request frequency varies significantly across counties, with some counties showing considerably higher request numbers than others.  Philadelphia, Allegheny, Montgomery, Bucks and Delaware County are the most populous counties in Pennsylvania and are, not suprisingly,
 the counties with the most ballot requests. A better measure would be to use ballot requests/total registered voters or some other proportion.
 2. The relationship between Age, Party, and Vote by Mail Requests is interesting, especially as it relates to younger voters. The number of young Democrats requesting ballots doubles, sometimes triples the number of young Republicans requesting ballots. In fact, Republican numbers in the youth are roughly equivilant to all the other parties combined.
 3. Ballot Return Latency...return times vary across legislative districts with 2 districts in particular, the 11th and 12th districts reporting time much longer than the average. This includes Allegheny County and leads one to ask, why the discrepancy.
 4. Age and Requests...Over 58% of ballot requests came from those over 65. Ballot request by age appear to be bimodially distributed. This can perhaps be accounted for by two groups, the elderly and those in active military service.
 5. The data pose many interesting questions to be explored such as: 
 what was in the invalid dataset. Are there patterns in it? 
 Is it ever the case that a ballot is not approved? 
 Does party affiliation related to the month of the ballot request? 
 Does party affiliation correlate with a ballots approval, approval code, or 'not returned'.
