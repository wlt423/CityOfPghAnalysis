DESCRIBE flights;
-- 2. Would your model be efficient enough for use when the dataset was being written? Why or why not?
-- Probably Not. The model prioritizes read performance which sacrifices write efficiency. Frequent writes -- would require more maintenance overhead and slow ingestion.

-- 3. Would you recommend NoSQL here? Why or why not?
-- No. This dataset is relational, structured, and benefits from SQL operations. NoSQL would reduce query -- efficiency and increase complexity without added benefit.

-- Inspect the data types. Do you think each is appropriate for the content of the data? If not, how would -- change those? Why?

-- The only absolutely necessary change would be to change flight_number to varchar or text because flight -- numbers are alphanumeric and not really an actual number. For the sake of efficiency, further changes -- can be made. Year, month, day,and day of the week are overprovisioned and can be changed to int
